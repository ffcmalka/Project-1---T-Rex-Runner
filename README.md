# Project-1-T-Rex-Runner
T-Rex Runner Game

# Instructions
Allo the T-rex Dino is running away from animal control that want to take him for being the only dino to exist in the 21st century! Help Allo escape and run away! There are obstacles that you will need to jump over by clicking down on your mousepad. If Allo doesn't make the jump, he will be taken! **Are you ready to help Allo?**

## How to get started
- First I will start with building my HTML and creating different Ids for each element. **(example: "gameBoard")**
- Then, I'm going to do some basic styling with my CSS, so I can then start my Javascript
- In my Javascript file, I have to create varibales that match my Id's in the HTML file and then start working on my functionality for making Allo jump.
- Afterwards I have to create a functionality to see if Allo is running into any obstacles, in that case the user will lose, or to see if Allo is making each jump.

### Challenges I may Face
I think I'm going to have a hard time working on the animation side of the project, the jumping function, and simply my time management. 

#### How I plan to overcome challeneges
I plan to overcome these challeneges by building a schedule for myself for the next week or completing most of what I need throughout the weekend, so it's not as much of a burden next week. For the animation and jumping function, I plan on doing some reasearch to learn, but thereafter it would be idle to finish throughout the weekend, so that I can debug throughout the week. 

### MVP
- The animation 
- CSS and timed intervals?
- Allo the Dino
- Making everything look nice
